## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). 

It is an example of making Feathers Casl work. But it is not working!

## Getting Started

1. Do the necessary stuff like npm install

2. Do npm migrate

    ``` 
    npm run migrate  
     
    ``` 

3. Load the seed data
    ``` 
    npx knex seed:run      
    
    ``` 

    * Notes: The password for both users are '123456'

4. Run the app and cross your finger

There should be a question somewhere on github discussion asking about how to make things work.
